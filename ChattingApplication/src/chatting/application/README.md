GROUP CHAT APPLICATION

There are basically three java files in this project
1)Server.java
2)User1.java
3)StartClient.java  

First to initialize the project we need to run Server.java before any other file.
After the server is running create a client by running StartClient.java it initialize the thread and ask for the name of the client.
So everyTime to create new client we need to run StartClient.java.
Everyone is able to read the message send by the other client.

As implemented with basic Gui, frames are to be set side by side manually to get the look of the full project and its working.
Both back button in frame and close button can be used to close that client.
